# OST client := Open Source Teams client

A command-line client for Microsoft Teams written in Rust.

*Ost* means cheese in Danish.

## Features

- **TUI**: Interactive terminal interface with teams, channels, chats, and per-user message colors
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 device code flow for work/school and personal accounts
- **Messaging**: List chats, read messages, send messages (stable)
- **Teams**: List joined teams and channels (stable)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connection for push notifications (Trouter)
- **Calling**: Audio and video calls with RTP/SRTP media
- **Audio** (optional): Microphone capture and speaker playback (working)
- **Video** (optional): Camera capture via V4L2 and SDL2 display (WIP)

## Status

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| TUI | Working |
| Authentication | Stable |
| Chat / Messaging | Stable |
| Teams / Channels | Stable |
| Trouter (push) | Stable |
| Audio calls | Working |
| Video calls | WIP - may cause audio issues |

**Note**: Video support is work-in-progress. Building with `--features video-capture` may interfere with audio functionality. For reliable audio calls, use `--features audio` only.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.70+ (some dependencies are pinned for compatibility with older rustc versions)
- Linux (for audio/video features)
- Nix (recommended) or manual dependency installation
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner (optional, for convenience recipes)

### Dependencies

- **Audio**: ALSA development libraries
- **Video**: V4L2, SDL2, OpenH264

## Installation

### Using Nix (recommended)

The `shell.nix` provides all required dependencies. The `just` command runner executes recipes from the `Justfile`.

```bash
nix-shell
just build
```

### Manual

Install dependencies, then:

```bash
cargo build
```

For audio support:
```bash
cargo build --features audio
```

For video support:
```bash
cargo build --features video-capture
```

For full A/V support:
```bash
cargo build --features "audio,video-capture"
```

## Usage

### TUI (Terminal User Interface)

Launch the interactive TUI for browsing teams, channels, and chats:

```bash
teams-cli tui
```

Mouse controls are enabled automatically:

- **Click** a team to expand or collapse it, or a channel/chat to open it.
- **Wheel** scrolls the sidebar, messages, search results, or debug log under the pointer, three lines at a time.
- **Click a message** to select it; click the selected message again to toggle its loaded thread replies.
- **Click compose text** to focus the editor and place the cursor. Press Enter to send.
- **Click Help** in the header or status bar to open help; click or press any key to close it.
- **Click search** in the status bar (or press Ctrl+K), then click a result to open it. Click outside the search overlay or press Esc to close it.

Keyboard navigation remains available. For terminal text selection, use your terminal's mouse-capture override (commonly Shift+drag). Mouse capture is released when OST exits.

Desktop alerts use `notify-send` and your Linux desktop notification daemon. New messages in other conversations, messages received while the terminal is unfocused, and explicit mentions of your account can trigger alerts containing the sender, conversation name, and a short message preview. Ordinary messages in the focused conversation are quiet. Focus detection depends on terminal support; typing or clicking also establishes focus. Before the first focus event or interaction, OST treats the terminal as unfocused.

Your own messages, history loads, repeated deliveries, and messages more than two minutes old do not trigger alerts. Mentions use account IDs from Teams metadata; writing your display name in plain text is not a mention. Alerts wait until your account identity is available. A missing helper or notification daemon is nonfatal and logged in the debug pane. Delivery runs asynchronously with a bounded queue and timeout; excess or delayed alerts may be dropped during a burst or desktop-service stall.

To disable desktop alerts (including message previews), launch with:

```bash
OST_NOTIFICATIONS=off teams-cli tui
```

The values `0`, `false`, and `no` also disable alerts. Notifications are enabled by default.

### Authentication

Login with device code flow:

```bash
teams-cli login
```

Force re-authentication (ignores cached token):

```bash
teams-cli login --force
```

Check authentication status:

```bash
teams-cli status
teams-cli whoami
```

### Messaging

List recent chats:

```bash
teams-cli chats
```

Read messages from a chat:

```bash
teams-cli read <chat-id> --limit 20
```

Send a message:

```bash
teams-cli send --to <chat-id> "Hello from CLI!"
```

### Teams

List joined teams and channels:

```bash
teams-cli teams
```

### Real-time Notifications

Connect to Trouter for push notifications:

```bash
teams-cli trouter
```

### Calling

Test microphone (requires `--features audio`):

```bash
teams-cli mic-test
```

Test camera (requires `--features video-capture`):

```bash
teams-cli cam-test
```

Place a test call to Echo bot:

```bash
teams-cli call-test --echo --duration 20
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run the test suite:

```bash
just test
# or
cargo test
```

Verify mouse input and terminal cleanup in a pseudo-terminal with offline fixture data:

```bash
python3 tests/tui_mouse_pty.py
```

### End-to-End Tests

E2E tests require a valid login session. Run all e2e tests:

```bash
just e2e
```

Individual e2e tests:

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tests/e2e_trouter.sh` | Trouter WebSocket connection |
| `tests/e2e_chats.sh` | Chat listing |
| `tests/e2e_read.sh` | Message reading |
| `tests/e2e_teams.sh` | Teams/channels listing |
| `tests/e2e_echo123.sh` | Echo bot call test |

### Quality Checks

```bash
just check    # Run fmt-check, lint, and compile tests
just lint     # Run clippy lints
just fmt      # Format code
```
