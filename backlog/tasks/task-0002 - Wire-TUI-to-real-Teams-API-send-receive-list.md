## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The TUI currently renders with hardcoded mock data and has no connection to the Teams API. The compose box logs messages to tracing::debug but doesn't send them. The sidebar shows static teams/channels/chats, and the messages pane shows static messages.

This task is to replace all mock data with live Teams API calls so the TUI functions as a real Teams client. The CLI already has working API integration for send, chats, read, teams, presence, and trouter — the TUI needs to be wired up to the same backend.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Sidebar loads real teams and channels from the Teams API (teams command equivalent)
- [x] #2 Sidebar loads real chats/DMs from the Teams API (chats command equivalent)
- [x] #3 Selecting a channel or chat in the sidebar loads real messages (read command equivalent)
- [x] #4 Compose box sends real messages via the Teams API (send command equivalent)
- [x] #5 Incoming messages appear in real-time via trouter WebSocket push
- [x] #6 Presence indicators reflect real online/offline status from the presence API
- [x] #7 User name and connection state in header/status bar reflect actual auth state
- [x] #8 Unread counts on channels and chats reflect real unread state
- [x] #9 TUI gracefully handles API errors (auth expired, network issues) without crashing

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Refactor API layer: Add data-returning variants of list_chats, read_messages, list_teams, whoami, get_presence alongside existing print-to-stdout functions. Make response types (Conversation, NativeMessage, Team, Channel, MeResponse, PresenceResponse) pub.

2. Switch TUI from sync to async: Change tui::run() from blocking to async, use tokio runtime. Replace crossterm::event::poll with tokio::select! over event stream + mpsc channels for API responses.

3. Add async backend module (src/tui/backend.rs): Manages a tokio mpsc channel pair. TUI sends commands (LoadChats, LoadMessages, SendMessage, LoadTeams, LoadPresence) and receives responses. Backend spawns async tasks that call the API and send results back.

4. Wire sidebar to real data: On startup, call list_teams_data() and list_chats_data() via backend. Replace mock SidebarState::default() with loading state, populate when API responds. On channel/chat selection, trigger LoadMessages.

5. Wire messages to real data: When a channel/chat is selected, call read_messages_data(chat_id, limit) via backend. Convert NativeMessage to the TUI Message struct (strip HTML, parse timestamps). Replace mock_messages() with empty initial state.

6. Wire compose to send: On Enter in compose, send the message text to the backend with the current chat_id. Backend calls send_message(). On success, append the sent message to the messages list or re-fetch.

7. Wire header/status to real auth: On startup, call whoami_data() and get_presence_data(). Populate user_name, is_online, connection_state from actual API responses.

8. Error handling: Display API errors in status bar or as flash messages rather than crashing. Handle 401 (show "Login required" in status bar), network errors gracefully.

9. Trouter integration (stretch): Spawn trouter connection in background, parse incoming message events, append to messages list when matching current chat.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented async backend pattern with mpsc channels bridging sync TUI and async API.\n\nReview fixes applied from MPED architect:\n- HTML-escape outgoing message content (security)\n- Fix Backend::recv() doc comment (was misleadingly described as non-blocking)\n- Deduplicate CLI functions to call _data() variants (DRY)\n- Log errors when backend cmd_tx.send() fails (observability)\n- Close search overlay on data reload to prevent stale indices (correctness)\n\nAC #5 (trouter real-time) and #8 (unread counts) deferred as follow-up tasks - require trouter WebSocket integration which is a separate concern.

The previously deferred real-time push reception and unread indicators are now implemented and verified on the TUI activity integration branch.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
The TUI uses real Teams API data for teams, chats, message history, sending, user identity, and presence. Incoming messages now refresh automatically through a quiet push subscription with bounded fallback polling, and unread indicators use native read metadata plus per-account local state. Messaging connection health is displayed separately from presence, and API failures remain recoverable.

The completed integration passed 147 Rust tests, formatting, default all-targets Clippy, release build, and terminal cleanup checks. A read-only release smoke test verified actual push registration and chat metadata loading.
